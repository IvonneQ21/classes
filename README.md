# Classes

## Introduction

**In JavaScript, _Classes_ (or _Class Constructor Functions_) are functions that return objects, which are referred to as _instances_ of that class. Class constructor functions promote well organized code as well as code reuse. Class constructor functions are frequenty called with the `new` keyword which facilitates leveraging the `this` mechanism and  _prototypal inheritance_, both which support code reuse.**

It is worth noting here that in the field of Computer Science, _Class_ has a formal definition, and, there are many computer languages that use classes as they are formally defined. **JavaScript is not such a language and it does not have classes at all as they are formally defined in Computer Science. JavaScript programmers use the term out of familiarity with other languages, and because of similar behavior within their code, in spite of the fact that in JavaScript they are doing something quite different than in other languages.**
